## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Feature scaling and categorical encoding for optimal input.
- **Sequential API**  
  Standard feed-forward neural network using `tf.keras.Sequential`.
- **Functional API**  
  Flexible model architecture using `tf.keras.Model`.
- **Model Evaluation**  
  Assessed using MSE (loss), MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
- **Architecture Comparison**  
  Side-by-side evaluation of modeling performance.
